## I'v learned how to add a Level 2 Heading

also line breaks  
(maybe)

This is an Unordered list:
- This is a List Item
- Also a List Item
* a List Item with Asterisk
* Another Asterisk List Item
- Back to the Dash

**I am Bolded text**  
__I am also Bolded Text__
(i am not a line break)  

I am a new line

I modified this file too

  This is added on the Development Branch  
  This too!
